# tableau-citibike

Project to interrogate data and find insights to act on. 
The available data was immense, I chose one file in the end to analyze. 
This file contanied a diverse data-set, but for a limitted time.
I did not feel this was a detriment and continued with connecting and 
created one data source from the connections made with the single file and
multiple tables.

The data reveals the % of total trips per gender. I was interested to know if location was a significant 
data point for the total number of trips.
